## Abstract

This BTP report presents the development of a portable and accessible rice classification system designed to address the need for accurate grain quality assessment and adulteration detection. This type of system is essential for determining fair pricing and maintaining quality standards, particularly in the import-export business, where precision and reliability are of utmost importance. The system integrates a custom-designed 3D-printed grid that organizes rice grains for analysis and an Android application powered by a TensorFlow Lite model for on-device inferencing. The application processes images of rice grains, measures their dimensions such as lengths, breadths, and aspect ratio, then using the decision rules provided by the FSSAI application, calculates adulteration percentages and provides detailed outputs, including annotated images, CSV files of grain measurements, and histograms for visual representation. Our application is able to achieve MAE of 0.043mm or 43 microns in length and 0.057mm or 57 microns in breadth. The application is developed with keeping portability, accessibility, and scalability in mind. The system is such that it can be used in various environments, even without the need for an internet connection.
