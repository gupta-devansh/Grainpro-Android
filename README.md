## Abstract

This thesis presents the development of a portable and accessible rice classification system designed to
address the critical need for accurate grain quality assessment and adulteration detection. Such a system is
essential for determining fair pricing and maintaining quality standards, particularly in the import-export
business, where precision and reliability are paramount. The system integrates a custom-designed 3Dprinted grid that organizes rice grains for analysis and an Android application powered by a TensorFlow
Lite model for on-device inferencing. The application processes images of rice grains, measures their
dimensions, calculates adulteration percentages, and provides detailed outputs, including annotated
images, CSV files of grain measurements, and histograms for visual representation. The system demonstrates robust accuracy for practical use with a mean absolute
error of 0.043 mm in length and 0.057 mm in breadth. It is designed to operate entirely offline and ensures portability and accessibility, making it
suitable for diverse environments and use cases. This work represents a significant step toward leveraging
machine learning for reliable, real-world grain quality assessment.
